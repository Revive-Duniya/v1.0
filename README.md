## Use of Hedera

How can Hedera Hashgraph enhance our project?

Hedera Hashgraph offers several advantages that greatly benefit our project. One of the key benefits is its ability to enhance the user experience. In traditional blockchain networks, high gas transaction fees can be a significant barrier for users, especially when engaging in activities like playing games. However, with Hedera Hashgraph, we can execute transactions with remarkably low fees, significantly improving the overall user experience.

Furthermore, Hedera Hashgraph provides Mirror Nodes, a cutting-edge technology that enables us to retrieve data about users' NFTs, tokens, and other relevant information swiftly. This capability allows us to get data very fast compared to traditional blockchains.

By leveraging smart contracts on Hedera Hashgraph, we can embrace a decentralized approach to managing subscriptions and NFT assets. This decentralized framework instills trust in our users, as they can rely on the transparency and security offered by smart contracts.

Moreover, the integration of NFTs within our project gives users greater control over their digital assets and a clear understanding of what is happening within the ecosystem. This feature empowers users, ensuring they have ownership and visibility over their virtual possessions.

In summary, Hedera Hashgraph provides numerous benefits for our project. It improves the user experience by enabling low-fee transactions, offers fast data retrieval through Mirror Nodes, facilitates decentralized management of subscriptions and NFT assets using smart contracts, and empowers users with control over their digital assets. 

## Architecture

We place significant trust in both mirror nodes and smart contracts in our frontend and game application. Smart contracts primarily handle transaction execution, while mirror nodes provide comprehensive data about user wallets. In the case of Hedera, it's important to note that gas fees are required for query transactions. However, we have implemented measures to enhance the user experience.

## DUN and GRC fungible tokens
VALUE PROPOSITION: 

We empower players to embark on an eco-conscious journey that blends entertainment, earning potential, real-world impact and positive change whilst immersing them in an immersive, AI-driven gaming experience. 


TOKENS UTILITY (DEMAND)
DUN token: in the game, DUN is used for valuable and exclusive purchases that affect the playerâ€™s performance. Demand for DUN will come from:
 
Characters
Special Vehicles
Special Emotes
Special Clothes
Fighting styles
Betting 
NFT subscriptions
Lending a NFT
Buildings
Governance 
Staking 

GRC Token: in the game, GRC is used for more generic purchases. Such as: 

Food
Skins
Farm Animals 
Farming Equipments 
Rewards 

TOKENS SUPPLY
DUN Token: DUN will be unlocked at a predetermined schedule lasting 60 months starting from the public sale of DUN, ensuring a gradual release and reducing the risk of token dumping. The total token supply for DUN is 300,000,000 tokens. The initial circulating supply is set at 75,000,000 DUN i.e 25% of the total supply. 

GRC Token: the initial mint amount for GRC is set at 30,000,000 GRC. After the initial mint, a 3% (transaction fee) of each GRC transaction will be burned manually to reduce the over-supply and over-circulation of GRC.
